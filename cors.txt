CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

When two web applications from different domains wants to share some data like files, photos, etc CORS comes into picture.

Basically, you can't share any resource with other web application from different domain if CORS is not enabled.

CORS allows one web app to share its resources with other.

HEADER: [Accept-Control-Allow-Origin: *]

We can replace the domain names with *, we can keep the desired domain name to prevent CORS error.
