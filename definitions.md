- **Javscript**
  - It is a synchronous single threaded language.
- Execution Context
  - Everything in javascript happens inside an execution context.
  - As soon as the javascript code runs, a global execution context will be created and pushed into the call stack.
  - A global object will also be created.
  - There will be 2 phases in execution context
    - Memory creation phase
      - javascript skims through whole code and allocates memory to every variable and function in key value pair format.
      - for variables it assigns a special keyword called 'undefined' and for function it copies the whole function code and assign to the function name.
    - Code execution phase
      - Here, code execution starts line by line.
- Hoisting
  - hoisting happens in the memory creation phase.
  - It does allocates the memory to the varibles and moves to the top of the scope.
  - only var declared variables and function statements will get hoisted.
  - Other variable declaration like let, const will get hoisted in temporal deadzone where the variables can't be accessed in the runtime.
- this
  - whenever a JS code is run, the browser creates a global object and gives control to the program.
  - in global context level "this" keyword points to the "window" object.
  - we can use the browser offering methods via this or window keyword like window.setTimeout or this.setTimeout
  - But, we can directly use any method available in javascript without using this or window keyword as JS engine put it as default.
- undefined
  - undefined is a special keyword that acts as a placeholder to the variable in the memory allocation phase.
  - we can print the variable to the console even if the value is undefined, js engine doesn't throw any error.
  - difference between undefined and not defined is, undefined is a variable that exists but doesn't have any value whereas not defined means the variable doesn't exist.
- Scope
  - Scope can be defined as place where you can access certain variables, functions.
  - Different types of Scope:
    - Global Scope
      - In this space, any function can access any variable, function. Accessible to everything.
    - Module Scope
      - Current module
    - Function Scope
      - All variables and functions inside a function can access the data.
      - outside of the function, you can't any variables, function outside the function.
 - let and const
   - let
     - let keyword is introduced in ES6 and this variable declarations hoist in temporal deadzone.
     - temporal deadzone means, the time between declaration and execution of the variable.
   - const
     - const keyword is introduced in ES6 and this variable declarations hoist in temporal deadzone.
     - you can't simply declare a variable using const keyword. You should initialize it otherwise syntax error will occur.
 - Block
   - Block is a compound statement where we can combine multiple lines of code and put it at a place where java script expects only one line of code.
   - Ex: if(true) true - this line of code is result out to be but we see some cases where true can be decided based on more lines of code.
   - Ex: if(true) { ... lines of code }
 - Closure
   - A closure can be considered as a function bundled with its parent environment.
   - It remembers the variables, function from its parent environment even though the function returned from its context.
   - The closure still remembers the variables, functions associated with it and can access them in other context.
