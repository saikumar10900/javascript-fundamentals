- **Javscript**
  - It is a synchronous single threaded language.
- Execution Context
  - Everything in javascript happens inside an execution context.
  - As soon as the javascript code runs, a global execution context will be created and pushed into the call stack.
  - A global object will also be created.
  - There will be 2 phases in execution context
    - Memory creation phase
      - javascript skims through whole code and allocates memory to every variable and function in key value pair format.
      - for variables it assigns a special keyword called 'undefined' and for function it copies the whole function code and assign to the function name.
    - Code execution phase
      - Here, code execution starts line by line.
- Hoisting
  - hoisting happens in the memory creation phase.
  - It does allocates the memory to the varibles and moves to the top of the scope.
  - only var declared variables and function statements will get hoisted.
  - Other variable declaration like let, const will get hoisted in temporal deadzone where the variables can't be accessed in the runtime.
