EVENT LOOP

- Event loop does monitor the javascript callstack to gets empty.
- As soon as it becomes empty, it pushes the tasks that are queued in microtask and callback queues.
- Microtask queue has more priority than callback queue. So, callback has to wait until all tasks gets completed from microtask queue.
